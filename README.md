# Project Description
This project is about Full Speed USB 2.0 driver. In this project STM32 MCU acts as a USB peripheral device which connects with laptop/PC using a USB and sends mouse HID report to The USB Host(Laptop/PC) using Interrupt endpoint.
In this project I also used CMSIS driver layer to perform Cortex M4 initializations.
